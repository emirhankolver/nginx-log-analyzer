# Project Roadmap

## Version 1.2 — Core Usability & Performance
**Goal:** Make the analyzer usable with real-world Nginx logs.

- [ ] File upload support (drag & drop + manual select).
- [ ] Streaming or chunk-based log parsing to handle large files.
- [ ] Optimize `analyze()` for high-volume inputs (memory-safe parsing).
- [ ] Introduce `exploits.json` for modular exploit / pattern detection.
- [ ] Basic progress indicator while analyzing logs.
